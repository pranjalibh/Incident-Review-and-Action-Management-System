# Incident-Review-and-Action-Management-System

The Incident Review and Action Management System is a full-stack web application designed to support blameless incident post-mortems, structured incident reviews, and severity-based SLA enforcement.
The system focuses on learning from incidents rather than assigning blame, while ensuring corrective actions are tracked, verified, and completed within defined timeframes.
